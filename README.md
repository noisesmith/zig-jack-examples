# zig-jack-examples
ports of the example jack audio code to zig

The intention is that this repo will be useful as a side by side comparison of
the original C code and the Zig translation.

My new code is offered under the GPL license. I have modified the original
code under the orig/ directory to include a link to the github repo that it
comes from but otherwise leave it intact, some files from that repo are
explicitly provided under GPL and others offer no license information. To be
safe in respecting the rights of the original authors I offer the code here
under a GPL license, and they are of course free to offer their copy of their
original work under any terms they like.

The original C examples are at https://github.com/jackaudio/example-clients
