# zig-jack-examples
ports of the example jack audio code to zig

The intention is that this repo will be useful as a side by side comparison of
the original C code and the Zig translation.

This code is offered under an MIT license, and though no license is offered on
the original example clients, it's assumed that they were presented as
instructive examples thus meant to be copied and expanded.

The original C examples are at https://github.com/jackaudio/example-clients
